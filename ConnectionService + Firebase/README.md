## ConnectionService
<table>
	<td>
ConnectionService is an abstract service used to handle VoIP & other calls. It is part of android.telecom package which helps to handle telecom services. ConnectionService can be used either as System-Managed Service where System defined UI is shown to handle the calls. It can also be used as Self-Managed Service where users can show their own calling UI to handle the calls.<br/>
<i>Note - Currently the sample app uses system-managed connection service, So the System UI will be displayed to handle incoming calls.</i>
